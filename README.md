# image-cryptography
In this project, an original scheme for secure image communication is presented, which combines the conventional DES cryptography algorithm with a chaotic signal generator based on a 3-order cellular neural network. A detailed simulation is conducted using the Wolfram Mathematica 7 software, the results of which indicate that many of the shortcomings of both purely-algebraic cryptography and purely-chaos-based cryptography have been addressed. In particular, for many applications, the scheme presented is more suitable than the DES algorithm alone.
Part I provides an overview of chaotic dynamics, cellular neural networks and the 3-order CNN, with illustrative simulations of their dynamical properties. Part II applies these concepts to the secure image communication scheme, which is discussed and simulated in some detail. Finally, the appendix contains an implementation of the DES algorithm.
The entire project documentation was prepared in Wolfram Mathematica 7.
